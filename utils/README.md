# README for the utils Folder

The `utils` subfolder contains utility functions that are used across various other subdirectories of the project.

## Folder Structure

The folder contains the following files:

- `DD_data_extractor_git.py`: This Python script contains various utility functions that are used throughout the project.
- `DDkinematic_final.py`: This Python script contains functions for calculating kinematic features.

## Utility Functions

The utility functions provided in this subfolder are essential for different aspects of the project:

- The `DD_data_extractor_git.py` script includes functions for data extraction and manipulation, among other tasks.
- The `DDkinematic_final.py` script contains functions for calculating kinematic features, such as `eta_to_theta`, `vec_3D`, `deltaphi`, and `deltaphi3`.

## Getting Started

To use these utility functions, import the necessary script(s) in your Python files. Ensure that all the required Python packages are installed.

## Additional Information

For more detailed information about the utility functions, refer to the documentation within the `DD_data_extractor_git.py` and `DDkinematic_final.py` scripts. These scripts provide a wide range of utility functions that are fundamental to the tasks performed in the other subdirectories of the project.
